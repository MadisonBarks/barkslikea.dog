# barkslikea.dog

Repository full of the code behind [barkslikea.dog](http://barkslikea.dog)

Could really be used to run any novelty site like it, just need to know a couple things:

- It reads a subdomain to determine who to put at the bottom. Therefore, [madison.barkslikea.dog](http://madison.barkslikea.dog) will show `madison`
- It relies on [punycode.js](https://github.com/bestiejs/punycode.js/), distributed through the Cloudflare CDN (thanks Cloudflare <3)
- Also relies on the great Bootstrap (v4 beta), just because it looks nice. And I'm not a designer.

## Script information

`customResponses` is a Javascript object, used due to a few friends wanting their own respones (and me just adding a couple because why not). I'm open to pull requests if you want your own thing in there. Keep in mind though, I make the final say in whether or not I want to accept it. It's my site, and I prefer to not have anyone take it away from me. 

Uhm... other than that, there isn't really much else to explain. Most everything else is pretty self-explainatory.

## Obligatory legal stuff

MIT sounds nice. So let's use that.
